NEAR Tip Me - a web3 tip me application based on NEAR platform
==============================================================

# Overview
NEAR TipMe is a tip-me project on NEAR platform. Evveryone can create an account ready to be tipped, tip other accounts, and withdraw tips from other accounts.

 - The contract code lives in the `/contract/assembly` folder.
 - The web app made by ReactJS framework

# Install

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥ 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: npm install --global yarn (or just npm i -g yarn)
2. Run the local development server: yarn && yarn dev (see package.json for a full list of scripts you can run with yarn)


# Build and Deploy

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.


## Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


## Step 1: Create an account for the contract

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `tipme.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `tipme.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account tipme.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet


## Step 2: set contract name in code

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'tipme.YOUR-NAME.testnet'

IMPOTANT: If you deploy contract to testnet server (accountId be like xxx.testnet), you should remove `process.env.NODE_ENV` at `src/utils.js`:

    const nearConfig = getConfig("development");

because When you run `npm start`, `process.env.NODE_ENV` is always equal to 'development', when you run `npm test` it is always equal to 'test', and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to 'production'. So if `nearConfig` is production config, all url are mainnet server, not testnet server that you deployed your contract! You maybe get this error:
`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69952774/reactjs-not-call-method-from-smart-contract-near-on-product-testnet-does-not`

## Step 3: deploy!

One command:

    npm run deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere.
